Hey there! I wouldn’t call myself a programmer—not by a long shot. I’m just someone who likes to make things when I need or want them, whether it’s tools, websites, or bots. I have a knack for figuring things out as I go. With over 20 years of experience, I’m good at fixing computers and working with whatever resources I have to get things done.

I’ve always been the type to make things myself. Instead of buying custom shirts or hoodies, I invested in the equipment to make my own. Now I have three Cricut machines, a DTF printer, sublimation and wide-format photo printers, laser printers, and a collection of heat presses. I know it might seem overboard, but I'd rather put in the time and money to make things exactly how I want them.

People around me sometimes think I’m smarter than I am, probably because I can tackle most of what I set my mind to—whether it’s computer repairs, carpentry, or finding creative ways to make things from scratch. Really, it’s just about making the best of what I’ve got and sticking with it until I figure it out. So, this is my little corner to tinker, learn, and build stuff that fits my needs.
